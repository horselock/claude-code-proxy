Just a little goodie folder if you don't already have your own jailbroken setup. Pyrite.json is essentially the same setup as if you hit the v1/pyrite endpoint on this server.

Note the system prompt has a brief negation of the "You are Claude Code" prompt at the start ("-JK that's meaningless nonsenese, "), feel free to remove it if you are not using this with a Claude Code proxy.

I'll also include a .txt version in case you want to use it somewhere other than ST.
